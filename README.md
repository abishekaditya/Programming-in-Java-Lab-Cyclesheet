1. Write a program to produce n-times multiplication table (n less than equal to 12). 

2. Write a java program StringRep that displays the string representation of a 4 digit
number (Eg. 4380 – four thousand three hundred and eighty).

3. Implement a Java program to generate 10 random integers and report whether they are
prime numbers

4. Write a java Program that inputs a long number, separates the number into its
individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by a tab space .

5. Write a Java program to generate Fibonacci Series using a recursive method.

6. Implement a Java program that reads a set of numbers through command line
arguments prints them and finds their sum and average.

7. Write a program to find an element in an Array by both linear and binary search

8. Write a program to find the Total and Grade of the following Students Mark using
array and display the results.

    Reg No | Name | Internal Mark(20) | External Mark(80)
    -------|-------|------------------|----------------------
    03BIT001 |ABHIJIT ANAND | 18 |30
    03BIT003 |AISHWARYA B |17|60
    03BIT005| ANITHA D. |18|55
    03BIT007| ANURAG GOYAL| 17|75
    03BIT009| ARCHANA M S| 19|45

9. Write and Execute a JAVA Program that prints the number of days in a given month.

10. A small airline has just purchased the computer for its new automated reservations
system. Write a java program to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only
plane(capacity:10)

11. Develop a class TelephoneIndex with two String objects as members. One for should
hold people’s name and the other should hold their phone number. The class should have
appropriate constructor, input and display methods. Create array of objects for
TelephoneIndex and do the following:
  a. Your program should ask the user to enter a name or the first few characters of
  a name to search for it in the array.
  b. The program should display all of the names that match the user’s input and
  their corresponding phone numbers.

12. Write a method that returns the common prefix of two strings. For example, the
common prefix of "distance" and "disinfection" is "dis". The header of the method is
as follows:
`public static String prefix(String s1, String s2)`
If the two strings have no common prefix, the method returns an empty string. Write a
main method that prompts the user to enter two strings and display their common prefix.

13. Some Websites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a method that checks whether a
string is a valid password. Suppose the password rule is as follows:
  a. A password must have at least eight characters.
  b. A password consists of only letters and digits.
  c. A password must contain at least two digits.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays "Valid Password" if the
rule is followed or "Invalid Password" otherwise.

14. Write a method that finds the number of occurrences of a string in another string
using the following header: `public static int count(String str, String ss)`. For example,
`count("Welcome", “come”)` returns 1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
string followed by another string and displays the number of occurrences of the second
string in the first one.

15. Write a method that returns a sorted string using the following header:
`public static String sort(String s)`
For example, `sort("acb")` returns abc. Write a test program that prompts the user
to enter a string and displays the sorted string.
